# About

Drs. Roy Cox and Juergen Fell recently published an excellent review/tutorial manuscript in Sleep Medicine Reviews, providing a useful overview of some common approaches -- and associated pitfalls -- for the analysis of sleep EEG data. Of note, the authors also provided open data and Matlab code, thereby enabling readers to reproduce and better understand the methods.

The National Sleep Research Resource is grateful to the authors for allowing us to host a public copy of these data.
